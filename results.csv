Q1,Q2,Q3,Q4,Q5,Q6,Q7
8,7,9,9,Learned more effecient way to write code. The game and activities are good for visualizing parallell programming.,I don't really understand which syncronization methods are preferred in which cases. ,We went very quickly through this and its not in the book. Some more material to go over outside of class would help.
10,10,10,10,Changing serial code to parallell especially seeing previous known functions like n queens & merge sort,Some tasks where I wasnt sure on the answer felt like I wasn't using time wisely as I just sat and tried to think,The merge sort game was a good idea to help illustrate what's going on. Maybe another thing similar to that. 
9,9,10,8,binary tree on parallell processing,eight queen game on parallel processing,more practice and more examples
7,9,10,9,I like the fact that we have the ability to write code that can run faster than what normal code would run.,Although code complexity is not a challenge coming up with parallel code takes some time & this is little concerning for finals,I liked the topic. I would recommend future 303 students to get involved in it too
10,10,10,10,It was very useful. I've heard about parallel programming often before but never looked into it. I will use it in my own projects now,I can't think of anything,I can't think og anything.
9,10,5,7,It's practical to the real world,I would like more examples. I don't think it was explained enough.,There is not enough time to finish the tasks that are requested of us. I also feel anxious when you walk around asking how random people are doing and you expecting them to talk about it. I can't focus when you do that and I don't like having a spotlight on me. 
10,9,10,10,Learning how to increase efficiency of my code,Would have like to learn about MPI,No
8,10,6,6,I learned more from the slides than the activites. The slides were clear and informative.,Perhaps a bit more practice? I guess theres not much HW anyway (big projects though).,I learned well what was taught (I think). I don't know if anthing else should be taught. Thanks!
6,7,8,6,It seemed like it could really save time and make certain code much more effecient,It seemed rushed and I didn't feel like the code and how to apply parallelization to serial code was very clear.,Maybe allowe for some small assignments or take home examples to practice parallelization.
8,8,6,6,All new material,Hand writing code,"Slowing down explanations, like when something in example code comes up that we may have already seen before, explaining it all the way through anyways."
9,10,8,9,It was interesting to see how much of a difference parallel processing made in the efficiency of the code,I didn't feel like enough time was spent covering the material,Spend a liitle more time on the material
10,10,8,9,The code were simple to understand,The merge sort the one we did with a partner,None
8,10,5,9,I like to learn about better ways to speed up code,The game seemed unneccessary ,another game
9,9,9,9,Good,Nothing,No
9,9,8,9,It was fun interacting with classmates,There wasn't anything I didn't like,No
8,10,9,10,Nice understanding of the basics,Wasn't as deep into Parallel programming as I thought it was,Go deeper
2,1,3,4,It was new and interesting,Lack of information. Quiz was hard and I feel the lecture material didn't coincide with the quiz.,Spend more time and give advance notice of the quiz. 
9,9,8,10,It is a really interesting topic and was explained in a simple yet informative way,"Some of the tasks, such as binary was difficult with limited knowledge",.
6,8,7,8,It gives us a preview about the operating system knowledge and help us understand and visualize what thread and race condition is. ,The way we implement it into our project. Since we are not very familiar with it. ,Make another project just for the parallel maybe an easier one
9,9,7,8,He broke down all of the steps on how to do it correctly,THe complexity of solving the coding for outputs of binary trees,nope
2,5,10,5,It's interesting,The confusion,Better lecture on material. The quiz on always for from material.
8,9,7,7,.,It's hard to understand,.
7,9,1,3,I liked the concept,The lack of detail and lack of time.,.
9,8,7,7,Learning new stuff,THe game was kinda stupid but I respect the thought,.
7,7,5,5,Introducing a tipic I had never heard of before,I feel like there is a lot more depth to the subject that wasn't explored.,Possible an exam dedicated to parallel programming.
10,9,9,5,Learn more thing. Can communicate w/ classmate.,The professor went through lecture a little bit fast but I really like this class,No!
5,7,6,5,LEarning how to make code run much faster. ,How quickly it went,More time spent on topics.
9,10,10,10,Exercises and code examples,More time with syntax. Maybve a practice program,practice programs. more time. 
6,8,4,4,Interesting and applicable,Very rushed,Take more time to show examples w/ locks and restrictions etc
8,8,7,9,I liked the practical aspects-parallel programming is interesting and the prof got the ideas across well,The merge sort game seemed pointless (could have just not been my learning style),More visuals like the merge sort diagram
7,7,5,7,"easy to follow for the most part, went back and parallelized old tasks to make them more effecient; lots of examples","section of reduction was pretty short, difference between that & atomic did not feel accurately explained. ",.
7,7,6,7,It was interesting,It's a litte challenging,better slides would help with more details
1,5,1,1,.,Source Code didn't work. Didn't see any difference in the debugger,get rid of it
4,5,3,5,I am at least aware of how much I setill need to learn on the subject,It is alternately self evident or difficult to comprehend; not sure,None on hand
9,10,9,10,Very informative and interesting,Got confusing at times,"Slow down on the Queens and Merge sort code, felt a bit rushed when actually showing code"
6,7,6,8,I liked the ways to parallel code,The confusion at what can and can't be parallelized,More examples
2,2,2,2,saves the time makes solutions run faster,code is complex,need spend more time
10,10,9,7,.,hard to understand,.
